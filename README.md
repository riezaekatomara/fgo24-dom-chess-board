## 📝 Description
A web application that creates a chess board using DOM manipulation. The project demonstrates dynamic HTML generation with JavaScript, CSS styling, and basic chess piece placement. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client side, with live-server for development.

## ✨ Features
- ♟️ Complete 8x8 chess board generation using JavaScript DOM manipulation
- 🎮 Interactive chess squares with proper coloring (black and white alternating pattern)
- 🏁 Row and column labeling (1-8, A-H)
- 📱 Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- 🎨 Clean and visually appealing chess board styling

## 🚀 How to Use
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 or newer
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or newer

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riezaekatomara/fgo24-dom-chess-board.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fgo24-dom-chess-board
   ```
3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application using live-server:
   ```bash
   npx live-server
   ```
5. Your default browser will automatically open with the application running (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)

## 📖 How It Works
The chess board is created dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation:
1. The code generates an 8x8 grid representing the chess board
2. Each square is colored appropriately (alternating black and white)
3. Board coordinates are labeled with letters (A-H) for columns and numbers (1-8) for rows
4. The application uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout
